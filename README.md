## 🔔 Toaster Notifications

This project uses a **toaster system** to show live notifications when:

* A new todo is added
* A todo is updated
* A todo is deleted

These notifications improve user experience by giving instant feedback.

---

💾 Local Storage

All todos are saved using **Local Storage**, which means:

* Your data remains even after refreshing the page
* No backend or database required
* Fast and lightweight

---

📏 Auto Height Adjustment

Todo items automatically adjust their height based on content length. This allows:

* Long text without overflow
* Better readability
* Clean UI

---

🧠 How It Works

* Todos are stored in an array
* The array is saved in Local Storage
* UI updates dynamically
* Events handle add, edit, delete
* Toaster gives real-time feedback
